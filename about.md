# Welcome

Welcome to the state of Maine Department of Marine Resources ME-NH Inshore Trawl Survey Data Portal. This portal contains summary results from the survey. You will find graphs of abundance and biomass indices and length frequency for each species over the survey time period. Environmental data collected on the survey is also available along with maps depicting the spatial distribution of catch in each survey.


### About the survey

The [Maine-New Hampshire Inshore Trawl Survey](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/projects/trawlsurvey/index.html) is a fishery-independent survey operated by Maine Department of Marine Resources that started in the fall of 2000. The survey is a collaborative partnership between commercial fishermen and state researchers to assess inshore fish stocks along the coast of Maine and New Hampshire. The survey occurs twice a year, in the spring and fall, and covers about 4500 square miles. A more detailed description and protocols for the survey can be found [here](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/projects/trawlsurvey/reports/documents/proceduresandprotocols.pdf). Reports and publications from the ME-NH trawl survey can be accessed [here](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/projects/trawlsurvey/reports/index.html).

#### Survey Design

The ME-NH survey is a random stratified survey, seperated into four depth strata and five geographic regions along the coast of Maine and New Hampshire. The inner boundary is defined by the shallowest depth that the 55-ft survey vessel can effectively sample (about 5 meters) and the deeper boundary loosely follows the 12 mile limit and overlaps with the inner depth strata surveyed by the National Marine Fisheries Service. One hundred and twenty stations are randomly selected for sampling before the start of each spring survey. The randomly selected sites that were sucessecfully sampled in the spring are resampled again in the fall. One, twenty minute, tow is scheduled at each randomly selected station.

If you have any questions or would like additional data please contact [Rebecca Peters](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/about/employees.html).

#### Note: All abundance and biomass indices are calculated using all four depth strata. If you need data for stock assessments please contact Rebecca Peters with a request.

### Technicalities

* At present, abundance indicies for lobster, Northern shrimp, and spiny dogfish are incomplete.
* Setting the theme of plots in Plot Controls is currently not working.

#### Planned enhancements

* Aggregated catch per grid cell (time series).
* Better plot controls.
