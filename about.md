### About the survey

The [Maine-New Hampshire Inshore Trawl Survey (MENH Survey)](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/projects/trawlsurvey/index.html) is a fishery-independent survey operated by Maine's Department of Marine Resources. The survey is a collaborative partnership between commercial fishermen and state researchers to assess inshore fish stocks along the Maine and New Hampshire coasts. The survey occurs twice a year, in the spring and fall, and covers about 4500 square miles. More detailed description and protocols for the survey can be found [here](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/projects/trawlsurvey/reports/documents/proceduresandprotocols.pdf)
