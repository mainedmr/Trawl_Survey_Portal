# Welcome

Welcome to the state of Maine Department of Marine Resources ME-NH Inshore Trawl Survey Data Portal. This portal contains summary results from the survey. You will find graphs of abundance and biomass indices and length frequency for each species over the survey time period. Environmental data collected on the survey is also available along with maps depicting the spatial distribution of catch in each survey.


### About the survey

The [Maine-New Hampshire Inshore Trawl Survey](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/projects/trawlsurvey/index.html) is a fishery-independent survey operated by Maine Department of Marine Resources. The survey is a collaborative partnership between commercial fishermen and state researchers to assess inshore fish stocks along the Maine and New Hampshire coasts. The survey occurs twice a year, in the spring and fall, and covers about 4500 square miles. A more detailed description and protocols for the survey can be found [here](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/science-research/projects/trawlsurvey/reports/documents/proceduresandprotocols.pdf)

If you have any questions or would like additional data please contact [Rebecca Peters](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/about/employees.html).

#### Note: All abundance and biomass indices are calculated using all four depth strata. If you need data for stock assessments please contact Rebecca Peters with a request.

### Technicalities

* At present, abundance indicies for lobster, Northern shrimp, and spiny dogfish are incomplete.
* Setting the theme of plots in Plot Controls is currently not working.

#### Planned enhancements

* Aggregated catch per grid cell (time series).
* Better plot controls.
